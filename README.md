# Chuck Norris Terminal Jokes
A fun easy little hack to get random Chuck Norris jokes in your terminal. Also have the option to pass in a different name.

## How to get it working
Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/ImagineDesignDevelop/chuck_norris_terminal_jokes.git
```

Create an alias 
```
alias norris="/directory/project/was/cloned/to/chuck-norris.sh" 
```

To always be able to run it add your alias to your .bashrc or .zshrc
```
echo 'alias norris="/directory/project/was/cloned/to/chuck-norris.sh"' >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

Now you can type in your terminal
``` termial
$ norris
Chuck Norris can access the DB from the UI.

$ norris John Doe
John Doe knows the value of NULL, and he can sort by it too.
```
